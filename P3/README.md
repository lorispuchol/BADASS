## Theory

### Virtual Private Network (VPN)
A technology that creates a secure and encrypted connection over a less secure network, such as the Internet. It allows users to send and receive data as if their devices were directly connected to a private network.

- **Types of VPNs**:
  - **Remote Access VPN**: Allows individual users to connect to a private network from a remote location using a secure tunnel.
  - **Site-to-Site VPN**: Connects entire networks to each other, such as connecting a branch office to a headquarters.

### Ethernet Virtual Private Network (EVPN)
EVPN stands for Ethernet VPN (Virtual Private Network). It's a modern network technology defined in several IETF RFCs, primarily used for layer 2 and layer 3 VPN services over an IP or MPLS network. EVPN uses BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) as the control plane to advertise MAC addresses, IP prefixes, and other information.

### Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS)
Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) is a routing technique in telecommunications networks that directs data from one node to the next based on labels rather than network addresses.[1] Whereas network addresses identify endpoints, the labels identify established paths between endpoints.
